## Statistics in Sciences

### Why this Blog ?
No one ignores that we went through a global pandemic these last few years, unreavelling striking discrepancies between what people think and what people really know about Sciences. Thus, as a bio-statistician (I am currently a Post-Doc in Stats Gen at the Bloomberg School of Public Healt at the John Hopkins University), I found that it could be relevant to provide materials to a large audience to better understand **How Sciences work** and **What is the role of Statistics in Sciences** Moreover, this blog will be the opportunity to invite experts from different areas to give their opinions in order to have the as large as possible picture of Sciences.
